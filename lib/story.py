        PART 1 - A Terrible Beginning
        -----------------------------

        Darkness rises from the east just as you enter the city hall. Shouting echos from the auditorium as you remove your cloak.
        
        'They are coming! Right now, from the Northern mountains, orcs march on your gates!', yells a desparate voice from
        the pulpit. 
        
        He looks exhausted, his clothes are covered in dried mud and stained with blood. The man scans the crowd deliriously, his 
        eyes are sunken and crazed. 
        
        'You must believe me!', he screams with even more intensity. The entire audience is now silent and staring in his direction.
        
        The exhuastion seems to be affecting him more now. The fear in his eyes is replaced with helplessness. His tone changes and 
        in a quiet but firm voice, he says...
        
        'My name is Tracon Bim. I am a hunter from the western city of StoneStill. Four days ago, I set out with a party of twenty, 
        of the finest huntsmen in the land, for the Western slopes of the Great Mountains. We reached our destination after 2 days, just 
        as the morning sun broke the night sky. But as soon as we entered the tree line, orcs riding vicious wargs were upon us. We had 
        no time to react. At first there was one and then two, by the time we knew what has happening half our party was dead. Those 
        of us who remained, were driven up the mountain and deep into the forest. Those damn monsters were clever... They surrounded 
        us to prevent our retreat back to the open plains with our horses. Most of us were too slow... but Fat John and I managed to 
        escape the slaughter with two surviving pack horses. We were quickly separated in the dense forest, but all we could do was run. 
        By mid-day my horse was exhausted, she tripped on a tree root and broke her leg, poor thing. I was thrown clear and woke up as 
        just as the sun began to set. In the distance I could hear wargs howling. They were on my trail... I began to run and did not 
        stop until I reached the edge of the Eastern plains. I peered into the darkness of the vast plain, looking for any sign of orc 
        or beast. In one direction I could see the faint light of your great city and in the other I saw lights from the foothills of 
        the Northern range. It was faint, but against the darkness of night, it was like a piercing beacon... I ran. I ran and 
        did not stop until I pounded on the gates of your city. I have no proof to show you with my hands... but I know in my soul 
        that those lights mark an army of death. And it is coming for this city... They are coming-'

        Just then, Ratheon, head of the city guard, approaches the pulpit and gently pulls Tracon away from the stage before
        turning back to address the hall.

        'People of Canrier. I am saddened to say... that this is not the first report we have heard of orc hordes moving south 
        from the reaches of the Great Mountains.', Ratheon proclaims in a clear voice.

        'Good Tracon, is correct in his intuition... Our scouts have just reported movement in the foothills. And confirmed the existence
        of an orc army.'
        
        The whole room begins to stir and panic seems to settle in the villagers around you. Ratheon, stares knowingly at the crowd and 
        raises his hand for silence. 

        'Do not mistake this threat as the end of our city.', Ratheon pauses and looks out at the crowd and at you. 

        'This is city has a secret. A powerful secret that will take more than an army of orcs to overcome... For we house, quietly and
        without fanfare, Heros from the King's War. Hero's whose ability on the field of battle is legendary. They are your neighbours,
        friends and barkeeps. These Hero's are the last remnance of the King's Guard.'

        The crowd gasps as Ratheon strides toward you.
